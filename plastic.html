    <h1>Single-use Plastic</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        Plastic is used widely these days and is a part of every common household. Plastic is easy to use and is a flexible material, but it also means that  the increase in the plastic leads to the increase in the amount of the disposed of. There are two ways to deal with such situations; the first is to make use of the best alternative to plastic and the second is to recycle the plastic that is need of the present time. It is of huge surprise that plastic contributes towards the 12% of the total solid waste that is disposed of. The plastic is really a threat to the ecosystem as the 90% of the waste that is floating over the ocean is of the plastic. A large number of the marine animals and the seabirds are dying every year due to the plastic contamination and many are found to have plastic in their bodies.<br><br>
        Plastic recycling is really an important step to be taken as it takes centuries for the plastic to breakdown on the ocean or in the landfills. To conserve the energy, landfills and environment, plastic should be recycled.
